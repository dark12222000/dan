Running a tabletop role-playing game can seem daunting, often resulting in either over or under preparation that could kill a game before it even begins. Depending on the personality of a game master it can be easy for the hype of beginning a new campaign to turn into fear. This fear may lead to a concern that the world isn’t fleshed out well enough or to procrastinate and just hope everything works out.

Great gaming ideas are only worthwhile if people get to play the game. A game master may have grandiose ideas for the world, it’s people, and it’s story arc, to the point of needing to name every tavern before players take their first breath. Such over preparation leads to false progress and inflexibility. Players aren’t predictable and if a story arc is overdeveloped it can all come crashing down. It’s important to remember that both the players and the game master are ultimately playing to have fun. Frustrations resulting from a story being “broken” because of a player’s actions, which they consider fun, will lead to no one having fun.

Knowing the game’s rules but not having an understanding of the world, it’s inhabitants and their motivations will result in a lifeless world. Improvisation can be a powerful tool but also potentially a crutch for procrastinators. Knowing what may happen if the players do not intervene can be a great stepping stone to understanding motivations, then the important characters with their motivations, followed by the setting. Plan enough to feel confident that the players have a reason for being.

Lengthy rulebooks and building a world may seem like a monumental task no matter a game master’s mindset. Knowing how to skim and improvise will be invaluable skills that will improve over time. Ultimately, a game ran with friends will always be 100% more successful and fun than a game never played.
